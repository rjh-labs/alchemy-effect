/*
This file is used to provide a minimal set of exported types required to solve portability
issues in sub-modules (e.g. cloudflare/worker).

Sub-modules are expected to `export type * from "../../exports.ts";` to ensure that the minimal set of types are exported.

This is instead of:
1. `export type * from "../../index.ts";` which would export too many types
2. `export type * as Alchemy from "../../index.ts";` which creates very long, confusing types.

TODO(sam): figure out a way to avoid this entirely
